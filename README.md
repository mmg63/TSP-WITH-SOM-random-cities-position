# TSP-WITH-SOM-random-cities-position
 
## In this code, we illustrate the use of the linear topology for the cluster units in a Kohonen self-ofganizing map to sole a classic problem in constrained optimization, the so-called traveling salesman problem(TSP). The aim of the TSP is to find a tour of a given set of cities that is of minimum length. A tour consists of visiting each city exactly one and returning to the sta100rting city. The net has a linear topology, with the first and last cluster units.
